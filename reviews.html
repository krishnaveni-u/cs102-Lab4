                    <p>So, carrying on from WandaVision, Wanda continues her arc as a slaver who faces no consequences
                        for enslaving a town full of people to now being a mass-murdering slaver who risks the lives of
                        trillions of people's lives, destroys universes, enslaves more people, so she can murder a
                        child, which will help her switch her plan to murder a mother and kidnap her imaginary children.
                    </p>
                    <p>And her redemption arc is she notices she is a monster and ends her reign of terror in the last 2
                        minutes.</p>
                    <p>And we're meant to sympathise with her for those heinous acts because she is sad because she had
                        to stop imagining her children, and had to stop all the slaving and torture she was doing in
                        order to imagine some fake imaginary children.</p>
                    <p>It was loud and shiny and stupid, so it was fine as totally brainless, lightweight nonsense...
                        Pretty meh overall, and I stopped paying attention during some parts as I was thinking about
                        other things because it was not engaging at all.</p>

                    <p>Sam Raimi definitely put a splash of horror in this action film. Doctor Strange in the Multiverse
                        of Madness is darker & more violent than any previous MCU movie, which could be considered a
                        strength. However, I felt like there was not enough multiverse and maybe too much madness.
                        Despite the entertaining visuals, the plot is fairly chaotic, and the acting & dialogue are
                        inconsistent. This movie is an entertaining ride, but it's a little too messy to stand on its
                        own.</p>

                        The type of emotional mass masala movies should be dead! It's 2022 not 2005!

                    <p>Call it a magnum opus, or larger than life, but Vikram has been worth the wait. A Kamal Haasan
                        film always brings innovation with it, and Vikram aces it in action. Mounted on superlative
                        production values and a breathtaking pace, Vikram doesn't have one dull moment in its 146
                        minutes of running time
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The film starts with a series of murders, including that of Karan (Kamal Haasan) perpetrated by
                        a team of vigilantes that claims to be cleaning up the system by waging a war against the
                        system. Two of the three people murdered were policemen who had captured a large consignment of
                        drugs and hidden the same in an unknown place, and Karan was the foster father of one of them.
                        This is just the beginning. The Chennai Police Commissioner calls upon a crack team of sleuths
                        led by Amar (Fahadh Faasil) to trace down the culprits as they are the best in the business.
                        Amar and team go about systematically and conclude the case with a warning to the Commissioner
                        himself - that Amar knew who murdered one of the two policemen, and that Vikram, the original
                        leader of the Black Squad from the 1980s, taken for dead, is back to life and out on a mission
                        to rid the nation of the drug menace.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Vikram (Kamal Haasan) is in reality an undercover agent leading a team of vigilantes, cleaning
                        up drug mercenaries knowing very well that their current crop of antagonists headed by a local
                        drug lord Chandhan (Vijay Sethupati) are just small fish that must be dealt with. The real big
                        fish Rolex is who their ultimate aim is.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Vikram, helmed by Lokesh Kanagaraj is visually spectacular. A taut action adventure, it extracts
                        Kamal Haasan to his fullest potential, but doesn't showcase him in every frame to make
                        sufficient space for Fahadh Faasil and Vijay Sethupati too. In fact, the three men are the core
                        of Vikram, in very different roles that make the movie immensely watchable with a mix of myriad
                        emotions and action at its best. The climax is violent, with the use of an arsenal of firearms
                        and hand to hand combat, setting up a finger licking wait for the potential sequel where Vikram
                        will lock horns with Rolex (Suriya, playing a surprise cameo). Don't wait for Vikram to drop
                        into OTT platforms, for a film like this must only be watched in the theatres.
