                <p>Arun Neelakandan, a teenager from Kerala, joins KC Tech, a popular engineering college in Chennai for his graduation. 
                    He falls in love with college sweetheart Darshana at the first sight. They grow closer after Arun is ragged by his seniors,
                     but a few scuffles and incidents get the seniors suspended and they start dating. 
                     Arun accompanies his friend Antony to meet his online girlfriend, and feels attracted to her colleague. 
                     He lies to her, states he is single and they lean in for a kiss but they are interrupted by moral police. 
                     A guilt-ridden Arun confesses to Darshana, who lividly calls off the relationship. In the heat of their argument, 
                     they challenge each other that they will have other romantic partners better than each other.</p>
